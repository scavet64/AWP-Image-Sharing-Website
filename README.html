            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
                This project was created by Vincent Scavetta as the final project for the
                Spring 2017 Advance Web Programming course at Rowan University. The project goals
                were to build an image sharing website that users could create an account, upload
                images, and leave comments for others to see. These requirements were implemented
                using PHP, MySQL, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
                </br></br>
                Home.php is the main page that the user would be brought to if they were visiting
                for the first time. It was renamed to Home.php in order to make grading and 
                exploration of the files easier. In a production enviroment, this file would be my
                index.php.

            <h2>Limitations/Assumptions</h2>
            <p>
                <li>Accounts are pre-activated without needing to click the emailed link.
                        This was done to make testing/grading easier, however in a production enviroment
                        accounts would be defaulted to inactive.</li>
                <li>Users can view the website from their mobile device, however they cannot upload anything.</li>
                <li>There is no way to change your current password without using the password recovery link.</li>
                <li>Users cannot unblock another user.</li>
                <li>Only 10 comments can be shown at a single time on a photo.</li>
                </br>
                These issues will be fixed in a future release.
