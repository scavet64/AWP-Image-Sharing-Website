            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
                This project was created by Vincent Scavetta as the final project for the
                Spring 2017 Advance Web Programming course at Rowan University. The project goals
                were to build an image sharing website that users could create an account, upload
                images, and leave comments for others to see. These requirements were implemented
                using PHP, MySQL, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
                </br></br>
                Home.php is the main page that the user would be brought to if they were visiting
                for the first time. It was renamed to Home.php in order to make grading and 
                exploration of the files easier. In a production enviroment, this file would be my
                index.php.

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>
                <li>Users can register with a username, email, and password. Usernames must be unique.</li>
                <li>In the chance that a user forgets his or her password, a password recovery link is sent to the users email.</li>
                <li>Users can upload images with captions and leave comments on each uploaded image.</li>
                <li>The owner of the image can delete any comments that they do not like.</li>
                <li>All pictures and comments are tagged with a date.</li>
                <li>Users can be tagged with @.</li>
                <li>Tagging a user with @ creates a link to that users profile</li>
                <li>A users profile currently displays the date the user was created as well as their last login time</li>
                <li>Hashtags can be put on pictures when uploading. These hashtags can be searched for.</li>
                <li>Multiple hashtags can be searched for at once in the top search bar. Only photos with all searched hashtags will appear.</li>
                <li>Users can delete their account if they see fit. When they do, this action is irreversible
                and removes their uploaded photo. Their comments will remain however they are marked with [deleted].</li>
                <li>Users can change their password by viewing their profile page and clicking "change password".</li>
                <li>Users can block/unblock other users. A blocked user cannot comment on any photos uploaded by the blocker.</li>
                <li>Users can view this website from their phones as well as upload photos* <i>tested on an iPhone 7, YMMV</i></li>

            <h2>Limitations/Assumptions</h2>
            <p>
                <li>Accounts are pre-activated without needing to click the emailed link.
                        This was done to make testing/grading easier, however in a production enviroment
                        accounts would be defaulted to inactive.</li>
                <li>Only 10 comments can be shown at a single time on a photo.</li>
                <li>The users profile page is bare at the moment. There are plans to show recent images
                that user has uploaded.</li>
                </br>
                These issues will be fixed in a future release.
