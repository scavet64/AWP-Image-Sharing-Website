## Synopsis

This project was created by Vincent Scavetta as the final project for the
Spring 2017 Advance Web Programming course at Rowan University. The project goals
were to build an image sharing website that users could create an account, upload
images, and leave comments for others to see. These requirements were implemented
using PHP, MySQL, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
